    **Description:**

        This class implements ReAct planner, which inherits from the BasePlanner base class.
        ReAct employs reasoning and action techniques to ascertain the essential actions to be undertaken.

        This code defines a base class called "BasePlanner" that inherits from the "BaseModel" class of the pydantic library.
        The BasePlanner class serves as a base for implementing specific planners.

reach to the Final Answer. You have access to the following tools: \
Use the following format. You should stick to the following format:
MetaData: this contains the name of data files of different types like image, audio, video, and text. You can pass these files to tools when needed.
History: the history of previous chats happened. You should use them to answer user's current question.
Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do. Ask yourself how to break down the Question into actions using tools. \
you may need to call tools several times for different purposes.
Action: the action to take, SHOULD be only the tool name selected from one of [{tool_names}]
Action Inputs: the comma seperated inputs to the action should be based on the input descriptions of the task. \
The examples for a two input tasks are: input1,input2 or if datapipe is needed datapipe:key,input2
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Inputs/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: Your final reasoning or 'I now know the final answer'. when you think you are done you should provide the 'Final Answer'.
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question. It should be based on the tools result.
